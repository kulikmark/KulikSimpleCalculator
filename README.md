# Kulik Simple Calculator

This application is a calculator developed using clean Swift code, without the use of Storyboard. It features button animations that make the interface more interactive and appealing to users.

Additionally, the app supports swipe gesture recognition for deleting the last entered symbol, enhancing usability.

Moreover, the application dynamically adapts to different devices and screen orientations thanks to its use of Auto Layout. This ensures a consistent and visually pleasing appearance across all devices, from iPhones to iPads, and in both portrait and landscape orientations.
